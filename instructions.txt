Download a chromedriver from the below link

https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

After this step add the path in the notebook to connect with the chrome browser for selenium testing.

After that add your credentials for your linkedin login. 
If login is not provided we cannot see how many people liked the post.

After this an intermediate file is generated called output.csv which has all the names and titles.
There are some companies which have liked the post so we need to filter them out.

While creating the .csv the name and headline blank fields would have the details of the companies that have
liked that post.

After filtering that out we can start our relevance scoring.

The .csv file generated gives the score and the features that are tested with the final result.
